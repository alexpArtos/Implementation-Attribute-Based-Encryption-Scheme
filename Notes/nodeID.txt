- each node in a tree has a label
- individual nodes don't have labels, it is a property of the tree specifying a node's position in it
- trees are only built once, and nodes are not exchanged around
- the ID encodes the position in the tree: this means that it can only be affected by append operations. Indeed, this is the only time it can change
- therefore, the append operation can determine the Id of a node and set it 

- nil nodes have an ID ""
- root non-nil node has an ID "0"
- inner nodes have the ID of their parent followed by ":" and their index among the parent's children
- leaf nodes have the ID of their parent followed by ":=" and their value
