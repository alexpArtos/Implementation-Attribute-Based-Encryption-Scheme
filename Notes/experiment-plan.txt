Experiments for encryption:

- time to setup
- time to generate keys
- time to encrypt
- time to decrypt



- variables:
  - encryption with hash or multiplication
  - Key on G1 / Key on G2
  - number of attributes in the ciphertext
  - number of attributes in the universe
  - number of leaves in the policy
  - max size of a minimal set



Number of attributes in the universe:
- 5, 10, 100, 500, 1000

Number of attributes in the ciphertext:
- 5, 10, 100, 500, 1000

Types of policy:
- uniformly distributed per each set: n leaves, accept from 1 set to a number of sets equal to the number of leaves; try all powers of 2 between these two limits
- linearly increasing sets: one set with one literal, the next one with 2, then 3, and so on
- exponentially increasing sets, doubling each time


Setup: only depends on number of attributes in the universe

Encryption: only depends on number of attributes in ciphertext

Key Generation: only depends on total number of leaves in tree (it might be different for more complex schemes)

Decryption: depends on format of the policy and on number of attributes in ciphertext
